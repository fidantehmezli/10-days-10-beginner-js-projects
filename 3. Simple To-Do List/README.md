Day 3. Simple To-Do List.

https://bit.ly/3lPlofd

You can't tell I'm a developer if you don't build a to-do list at least once. ðŸ˜Š

That's why today we'll build a simple to-do list. We can add things to it and delete it when it is done.

What we'll learn by building a to-do list:

1. DOM

2. Event handling

3. Functions

4. Calling a function by using keyboard buttons.

As always, you can style it however you want and add things to make it your own.
